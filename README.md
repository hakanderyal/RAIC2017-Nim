# RAIC2017-Nim
A strategy for Russian AI Cup 2017 written in Nim

To start the strategy you need to place [local runner](http://russianaicup.ru/p/localrunner)
to the `../local-runner` folder relative to current repo path and copy files to from
the [Nim-cgdk](https://github.com/xomachine/nim-cgdk) to this repo root without replacing.

After that edit [Runme.sh](https://github.com/xomachine/RAIC2017-Nim/blob/ownsets/Runme.sh) to get necessary level of
logging/profiling/debugging and start it.
